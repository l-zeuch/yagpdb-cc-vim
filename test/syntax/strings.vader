# Available syntax functions are:
#   SyntaxAt(): current cursor position
#   SyntaxAt(col): current cursor line, at given column
#   SyntaxAt(lnum, col): line and column
#   SyntaxOf(pattern[, nth=1]): return a string with the name of the syntax
#     group at the first character of the nth match of the given pattern. Return
#     '' if there was no match.
