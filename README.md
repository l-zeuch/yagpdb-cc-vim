# YAGPDB Custom Commands Vim plugin

Syntax highlighting for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) custom commands in Vim.

## Note

This is still a work in progress and shouldn't be used if you  don't know what you're doing. Seeing as this is my first plugin for Vim, it may have some major bugs/flaws.

## Other Contributions

Some of the regex in this plugin was developed by [@DZ-TM](https://github.com/DZ-TM). If you like it, feel free to give him cookies as a reward.
